This server contains marine environmental monitoring data delivered to the Swedish National data host for oceanographic and marine biological environmental data.

The files follow a structure according to:
Monitoring year/Data type/Data deliverer (following RLABO codes; see SMHIs code list)/Version number (using date).

This data package contains chlorophyll data.

Investigation type: Water samples are collected at discrete depths using a water sampler or using a hose suspended vertically in the water column. The water is filtered and the chlorophyll content is determined by measuring fluorescence.

Data packages are compressed to zip-format.

The zip-file contains:

- File "README.txt": Describes in English the contents of the zip-file and the terms of use.

- File "README_sv.txt": Describes in Swedish the contents of the zip-file and the terms of use.

- File "shark_metadata.txt": Created by the Swedish National data host with an overview and description of the delivered dataset.

- Folder "processed_data": Contains one or multiple edited data files (e.g. semi-colon separated csv-, txt- or xlm-format), with corrected data (e.g. corrected codes, species, and station name) and adapted to the SHARK data handling system, a delivery_note.txt where the provider of the data describes the content of the delivered data and sometimes a change_log.txt file that specifies changes made by the Swedish National data host in the data review process.

- Folder "received_data": Contains one or multiple original data files from the data deliverer (e.g. semi-colon delimited, tab-delimited or xml files), followed by supplementary files from the data deliverer with relevant information for the delivered data (in different formats such as pdf).

- Folder "shark_generated": Contains a shark_data.txt file that shows the published data in a table with translated column names, a shark_column_data.txt with data organized in a table with one row per sample, a shark_metadata_auto.txt with detailed information of the data set (e.g. minimum and maximum latitude or the units of measurements) and a shark_translate.txt with translations for codes used in the data table.


Data is free to use according to the data policy described in "Terms of download"-link at the bottom of the SHARKweb page (https://sharkweb.smhi.se/).
